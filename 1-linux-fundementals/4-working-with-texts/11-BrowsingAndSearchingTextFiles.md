## Browsing and Searching Text Files with `more`, `less`, `head`, `tail`,`cat`,`tac` and `grep`
### ``more`` and ``less``
#### ``more``
- `more` is a command-line utility that is used to display the contents of a file one screen at a time.
- the original `more` command is not used much now, as `less` is more powerful and has more features.
#### ``less``
- `less` was developed to offer more advanced features than `more`.

##### Demo
- let's take a look at our system log messages. In redhat based systems, the system log messages are stored in `/var/log/messages`.
```bash
sudo more /var/log/messages
```
- use `space` key to go to the next page, `b` key to go back, `q` key to quit.
- lets use `less` to view the same file.
```bash
sudo less /var/log/messages
```
- use arrow keys to navigate. 
- let's use `less -f` to view the file in follow mode.
follow mode is used to view the file in real-time.

### ``head`` and ``tail``
utility to display the first or last few lines of a file.
#### ``head``
- `head` is a command-line utility that is used to display the first few lines of a file.
- by default, `head` displays the first 10 lines of a file.
- use `-n` option to specify the number of lines to display.
Examples:
- basic usage
```bash
head ~/.zshrc
```
```
# If you come from bash you might have to change your $PATH.
# export PATH=$HOME/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH

# Path to your Oh My Zsh installation.
export ZSH="$HOME/.oh-my-zsh"

# Set name of the theme to load --- if set to "random", it will
# load a random theme each time Oh My Zsh is loaded, in which case,
# to know which specific one was loaded, run: echo $RANDOM_THEME
# See https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes
```
- using the `n` option
```bash
head -n 5 ~/.zshrc
```
```
# If you come from bash you might have to change your $PATH.
# export PATH=$HOME/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH

# Path to your Oh My Zsh installation.
export ZSH="$HOME/.oh-my-zsh"
```
- combining with `ls` command
```bash
ls -l /etc | head -n 5
```
```

```
```

drwxr-xr-x  2 root root   4096 Jan 10  2022 bash_completion.d
```
this will display the last 2 lines of the output of `ls -l /etc | head -n 5`

#### ``tail``
- `tail` is a command-line utility that is used to display the last few lines of a file.
- by default, `tail` displays the last 10 lines of a file.
- use `-n` option to specify the number of lines to display.
- use `-f` option to view the file in follow mode.

Examples:
- basic usage
```bash
tail ~/.zshrc
```
```
# users are encouraged to define aliases within a top-level file in
# the $ZSH_CUSTOM folder, with .zsh extension. Examples:
# - $ZSH_CUSTOM/aliases.zsh
# - $ZSH_CUSTOM/macos.zsh
# For a full list of active aliases, run `alias`.
#
# Example aliases
# alias zshconfig="mate ~/.zshrc"
# alias ohmyzsh="mate ~/.oh-my-zsh"
source /usr/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
```
- using the `n` option
```bash
tail -n 5 ~/.zshrc
```
```
#
# Example aliases
# alias zshconfig="mate ~/.zshrc"
# alias ohmyzsh="mate ~/.oh-my-zsh"
source /usr/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
```
- combining with `ls` command
```bash	
ls -l /etc | tail -n 5
```
```

```
- using the `f` option
```bash
tail -f /var/log/messages
```
this will display the last 10 lines of the file and will keep the file open and display new lines as they are added to the file.

### ``cat`` and ``tac``
#### ``cat``
- `cat` is a command-line utility that is used to concatenate and display the contents of a file.
- `-A` option is used to display all characters, including non-printing characters.
- `-b` option is used to number non-blank output lines.
- `-n` option is used to number all output lines.
- `-s` option is used to squeeze multiple adjacent blank lines into a single blank line. 
#### ``tac``
- `tac` is a command-line utility that is used to display the contents of a file in reverse order.
Examples:
- basic usage
```bash
cat /etc/hosts
```
```
# This file was automatically generated by WSL. To stop automatic generation of this file, add the following entry to /etc/wsl.conf:
# [network]
# generateHosts = false

```
- using the `A` option

```
```

- using the `b` option
```bash	
cat -b /etc/hosts
```
```

```
### ``grep``
- `grep` is a highly used command-line utility that is for searching for a specific string in a file.
- `grep` stands for `Global Regular Expression Print`.
- `grep` is case-sensitive by default.
- use `-i` option to make `grep` case-insensitive.
- use `-r` option to search recursively in directories.
- use `-v` option to invert the match. (exclusion of a pattern)
- use `-l` option to display only the names of files that contain the pattern.
- use `-A5` option to display 5 lines after the match.
- use `-B5` option to display 5 lines before the match.
- use `-C5` option to display 5 lines before and after the match. 
- very useful in piping
- use `2>/dev/null` to suppress error messages.
#### Basic Usage
```bash
grep root *
```
this will search for the string `root` in all files in the current directory.
```bash
grep -i root *
```
this will search for the string `root` in all files in the current directory, ignoring the case.
```bash
grep -r root /etc/passwd
```
this will search for the string `root` in all files in the `/etc/passwd` directory.
#### Using `grep` while piping
```bash
ps aux | grep http
```
this will search for the string `http` in the output of the `ps aux` command.

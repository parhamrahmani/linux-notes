# My favorite Linux distros
- [Linux Mint - XFCE](https://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=317)
  - Pros
    - easy to use
    - ubuntu/debian based so stable release cycle
    - support for xfce desktop which is my favorite DE
    - good community support
    - not super lightweight but not bloated as much as ubuntu
  - Cons
    - for gaming nees additional steps
      - the kernel has to be updated manually to the latest version
        - fixes some hardware issues
        - fixes when only the nvidia gpu is configured to be used. (with the default older kernel, after conffiguring to use ONLY nvidia gpu, the system won't boot)
    - not bleeding edge 
- [Endeavor OS](https://endeavouros.com/#Download)
  - Pros
  	- lightweight
  	- xfce compatible
  	- good for learning since it is more terminal based 
  	- arch based so bleeding edge
  	- awesome complete documentations
  	- better for gaming
  	- easier installation than arch
  - Cons
    - rolling release so can be unstable
    - more difficult to use than mint
    - out of my comfort zone (which is debian based distros)
